\secrel{Modeling Miniature Machine Tools}\secdown

You will probably not be surprised to find that people who are interested in
miniature machine tools often find it fun to make miniature models of full-size
tools. This page shows beautiful examples of a lathe and a mill from two expert
craftsmen.

\bigskip
\textit{Barry Jordan built a 2"\ diameter rotary table and then needed a machine
to use it on. The result was this 1/5 scale Bridgeporl mill. The project was started in
1997 and completed just in time for Bridgeport's 60th anniversary in 1998. What
started as a model filmed into a real machine in miniature, capable of actually
cutting small parts in mild steel.}

\bigskip
\textit{The pans are all machined from aluminum and billet cast iron. No
castings were used. The polished pulley cover is made from Dural. More of Barry Jordan's
miniature tools can be seen on page 246.}

\bigskip
\textit{This small but fully functional 1/6 scale Hardinge lathe was modeled by
Wilhelm Huxhold of Ontario, Canada. A lifelong machinist, he shows his love for
machine tools by modeling them in miniature. Unlike Barry Jordan's Bridgeport,
this project took many years to complete. More of Mr.Huxhold's work can be seen
on pages 22 and 217. A profile of his career is presented on page 330.}
