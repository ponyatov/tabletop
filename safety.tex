\textbf{A patternmaker's interview for employment}

\bigskip
One of the best patternmakers I ever knew apprenticed in the trade for many
years with his father. When he went to work for U.S. Steel in their pattern
shop, the foreman who was interviewing him for the job asked him to hold out his
hands. When the fo reman could see that the applicant still had all ten fingers,
he was hired. The foreman could see from his work that the patternmaker was a
good craftsman, but he figured that if he had been working in the trade that
long and still had all his fingers he must be a good, safe worker too, and that
was just as important.

Spinning tools that are powerful enough and sharp enough to remove metal can
also remove just about anything else that gets in their way. Though less
dangerous than their larger full size shop counterparts, small power tools can
still cause serious injury to those who don't show them the proper respect. Even
hand tools used improperly can cause injury. Talking about safety is not nearly
as fun as talking about the beautiful miniature machining projects in this book,
but working safely is part of the skill of a good craftsman.

Working safely is simply a series of habits that you develop. Once they become
habits, it takes no longer and is no less enjoyable to work that way than to
work with unsafe habits. Injuries definitely take the fun out of working with
tools, and fun is what miniature machining is all about. Please read these rules
and apply them until they become habits so that you can enjoy your hobby to the
fullest.

\begin{enumerate}
\item\textcolor{Red}{KNOW YOUR POWER TOOL}-Read the owner 's
manual carefully. Learn the tool's applicati on and
limitations as well as the specifi c potential hazards
peculiar to this tool.
\item\textcolor{Red}{GROUND ALL TOOlS}-If a tool is equipped with a
three-prong plug, it should be plugged into a threehole receptacle.! fan adapter is used to accommodate
a two-prong receptacle, the adapter wire must be
attached to a KNOWN GROUND. Never remove
the third prong. (See drawing on next page.)
\item\textcolor{Red}{KEEP GUARDS IN PLACE}-and in working order.
\item\textcolor{Red}{REMOVE ADJUSTING Km AND WRENCHES}-Form a
habit of check ing 10 see that keys and adj ust ing
wrenches are removed from the tool before turning
on your mac hine.
\item\textcolor{Red}{KEEP WORK AREA CLEAN}-Cl uttered areas and
benc hes invite accidents.
\item\textcolor{Red}{AVOID DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT}-Do not usc
power too ls in damp or wet locations. Keep your
work area well illuminated.
\item\textcolor{Red}{KEEP CHILDREN AWAY}-All visitors should be kept
a safe distance from the work area .
\item\textcolor{Red}{MAKE WORKSHOP KID PROOF}-w ith padlock s.
master switches or by removing starter keys.
\item\textcolor{Red}{DO NOT FORCE TOOL}- Do not force a 100 1 o r
attachment to do ajob fo r which il was not designed.
Use the proper tool for the job.
\item\textcolor{Red}{WEAR PROPER APPAREl}-Avoid loose clothing,
neckties, gloves or jewelry that could become caught
in movi ng parts. Wear protective head gear 10 keep
long hair sty les away from moving parts.
\item\textcolor{Red}{USE SAFETY GLASSES}-Also usc a face or dust mask
if cutting operation is dusty.
\item\textcolor{Red}{SECUREWORK}-Use clamps or a vise to hold work
when practicable. It is safer than using your hand
and frees both hands to operate the tool.
\item\textcolor{Red}{DO NOT OVERREACH}-Keep your proper footing
and balance at all times.
\item\textcolor{Red}{MAINTAIN TOOLS IN TOP CONDITION}-Keep tools
sharp and cl ean for best and safest performance.
Follow instructions for lubri cation and chang in g
accessories.
\item\textcolor{Red}{DISCONNECT TOOLS}-Unplug the tool before
servicing and when changing accessories such as
blades, bits or cutters.
\item\textcolor{Red}{AVOID ACCIDENTAL STARTING}-Make sure the
switch is "OFF" before plugging in power cord .
\item\textcolor{Red}{USE RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES}-Consult th e
owner's manual. Use of improper accessories may
be hazardous.
\item\textcolor{Red}{TURN SPINDLE BY HAND BEFORE SWITCHING ON
MOTOR}-This ensures that the workpiece or chuck
jaws wi ll not hit the lathe bcd, saddle or crosslide,
and also ensures that they clear the cutting tool.
\item\textcolor{Red}{CHECK THAT ALL HOLDING, LOCKING AND DRIVING
DEVICES ARE TIGHTENED} At the same time, be careful
not to overtighten these adjustments. They should
be just tight enough to do the job. Overtightening
may damage threads or warp parts, thereby reducing
accuracy and effectiveness.
\item\textcolor{Red}{WHEN WORKING THROUGH THE SPINDLE, DO NOT LET
LONG, THIN STOCK PROTRUDE FROM THE BACK END OF
THE SPINDLE SHAFT}-The end of unsupported stock
turned at high RPM can suddenly bend and whip
around.
\item\textcolor{Red}{It is not recommended that the lathe he used for grinding}.
The fine dust that results from the grinding operation is extremely hard on
bearings and other moving parts of your tool. For the same reason, if the lathe
or any other precision tool is kept near an operating grinder, it should be kept
covered when not in use.

\item\textcolor{Red}{WEAR YOUR SAFETY GlASSES}-Foresight is better than NO
SIGHT! The operation of any power tool can result in foreign objects being
thrown into the eyes, which can result in severe eye damage. Always wear safety
glasses or eye shields before commencing power tool operation. We recommend a
Wide Vision Safety Mask for use over spectacles or standard safety glasses.

\end{enumerate}

\secrel{ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS}

The power cord used is equipped with a 3-prong grounding plug which should be
connected only to a properly grounded receptacle for your safety.
Should an electrical failure occur in the motor, the grounded plug and
receptacle will protect the user from electrical shock. If a properly grounded
receptacle is not available, use a grounding adapter to adapt the 3-prong plug
to a properly grounded receptacle by attaching the grounding lead from the
adapter to the receptacle cover screw.

\textcolor{Red}{NOTE}: Electrical circuits designed into the speed control of
the Sherline lathe or mill read incoming current and automatically adapt to
supply the correct 90 volts DC to the motor. As long as you have a properly
wired, grounded connector cord for your source, the machine will operate on any
current from 100 to 240 volts AC and 50 or 60 Hz. without a transformerÂ·. This
should include just about any country in the world. Prior to 1994, an AC/DC
motor was used. Use the ACIDC motor ONLY with the power source for which it was
intended. It will not automatically adapt to any other current and using it with
an improper power source will bum out the motor or speed control.

\bigskip\textit{Proper grounding of electrical connections.}\bigskip

\textcolor{Red}{Older ACIDC motOR available from Grainge}\bigskip

Sherline' s supply of older ACIDC motors is slowly being depleted. A very large
run must be custom ordered to get more, and this is not economically feasible.
However, the Grainger catalog stocks a 115 horsepower motor identical to the one
used on early Sherline tools. The catalog number is 2M139.
They have locations in every state and can be found in the Yellow Pages under
"Electric Motors". Their web address is www.grainger.com. Your other option
would be to upgrade your motor and speed control to the newer, more powerful DC
version.

\bigskip
\noindent * The first DC units built in early 1994 did not include the circuits
to adapt to other currents. The capability to include that feature was not available to
Sherline at that time. As soon as it was, it was included. If you think you may
have an early DC model, remove the plastic speed control housing and look for a
label on the aluminum speed control frame. If it has a small metallic label on
top of the frame that lists input voltage as 120VAC, DO NOT A lTEMPT TO CONVERT
THIS UNIT TO OTHER CURRENTS. Models that can be used with any current have a
paper label on the end of the speed control frame which lists the model number
as KBLC-240DS.
